# 🚗 Car Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Car Sales dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration techniques.

---
## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Car Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Content**: Includes information on car prices, sales figures, specifications, and other attributes.  
- **Use Case**: Helps understand factors influencing car sales and price variations.

---
## 🔍 EDA Workflow
The analysis is organized into the following steps:
1. **Understand the Dataset Structure**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Univariate Analysis**
4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
5. **Key Insights & Observations**

---
## 📈 Visualizations & Insights
The notebook includes multiple plots and charts to analyze:
- Distribution of car prices & sales  
- Correlation between features  
- Trends in sales across categories  
- Factors influencing car pricing  

---
## ⚙️ Tech Stack
